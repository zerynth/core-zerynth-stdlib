GSM
***

This module implements a generic gsm interface.
To function correctly it needs a gsm driver to be loaded, so that the module can use
the driver to access the underlying hardware.

The link between the gsm module and the gsm driver is established without the programmer
intervetion by the driver itself.



Once the gsm driver is connected to the GSM network, this module can be used to access functionalities at different levels:

    * **Network level**: query the operators/carriers, select a carrier, retrieve the signal strength, retrieve info about the current cell
    * **Device level**: retrieve info about IMEI and SIM card
    * **Packet Switch Service level**: once attached to an APN, the standard socket interface is available. Secure sockets are available if the underlying driver supports them. Due to the nature of GSM networks (private networks behind a NATing APN), listening sockets are not implemented both for UDP and TCP. 
    * **SMS level**: receive, read and send SMS (not yet available)


The following constants are defined:

    * :samp:`AUTH_NONE`, no authentication required with APN
    * :samp:`AUTH_DETECT`, automatic authentication detection
    * :samp:`AUTH_PAP`, use PAP authentication
    * :samp:`AUTH_CHAP`, use CHAP authentication
